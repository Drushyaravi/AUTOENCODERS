# ECG Autoencoder Analysis
This repository contains code and documentation for performing autoencoders on an ECG (Electrocardiogram) dataset. Each row in the dataset represents a complete ECG reading of a patient, consisting of 140 data points. 
The aim is to use autoencoders to detect anomalies in the ECG readings.

## Introduction
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient codings of input data. This project leverages autoencoders to analyze ECG data and identify abnormal readings, which could indicate potential cardiac issues. 

## Dataset
The dataset consists of ECG readings of patients, where each row corresponds to a single complete ECG of a patient. The columns are as follows:
- **Columns 0-139**: These contain the ECG data points for a particular patient (floating point numbers).
- **Column 140**: This is the label indicating whether the ECG is normal (0) or abnormal (1).

## Usage
To run the autoencoder analysis, follow these steps:
- Preprocess the Data: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format as described above.
- Train the Autoencoder: Use the provided script to train the autoencoder model.
- Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the performance of the model on detecting anomalies.

## Model Architecture
The autoencoder architecture used in this project consists of the following layers:
- **Encoder**: Compresses the input ECG data into a lower-dimensional representation.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the ECG data from the compressed representation.
The architecture can be customized in the model.py file.

## Results
- After training the autoencoder, the model should be able to reconstruct normal ECG readings accurately, while reconstruction errors for abnormal ECG readings should be higher. This difference in reconstruction error can be used to detect anomalies.
- Sample results and visualizations are provided in the results/ directory.
